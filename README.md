Clone this repository.
Set up your MySQL database and configure the connection in the back-end.
Install dependencies:
cd backend
npm install
cd ../frontend
npm install

Start the development servers:
# In the backend directory
npm start

# In the frontend directory
The frontend is scaffolded with Vite using the react template 
 npm run dev

 in a web browser navigate to: http://localhost:5173

 By default Vite will run on port 5173. But if for some reason vite is running on a different port just replace the port number with what port vite is running on (The running port will be shown in the terminal window after running npm run dev)
